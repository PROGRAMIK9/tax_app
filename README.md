🧾 Open Audit
Transparent, private, and automated tax defense.

Open Audit is an open-source platform designed to take the fear out of tax season. Unlike proprietary "black box" software, Open Audit runs locally to ensure your financial data never leaves your machine. It helps freelancers, contractors, and individuals organize receipts, flag potential audit risks, and prepare IRS-compliant reports.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Anomaly Detection: AI-driven alerts for deductions that might trigger IRS red flags.

📄 Receipt Parsing: OCR-powered tools to scan, digitize, and categorize physical receipts.

🔒 Privacy by Default: Zero-knowledge encryption; your data lives on your device, not our servers.

🛡️ Audit Defense: Generates a timestamped, immutable log of all financial records to prove compliance.

📤 Universal Export: One-click export to PDF, CSV, or standard tax file formats (e.g., .txf).
